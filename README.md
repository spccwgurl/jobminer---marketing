# Strategic Copilot

An automated job search pipeline for anyone actively looking for their next role. Every weekday morning it scans your target companies' job boards, scores each posting against your profile using Claude AI, and writes only the relevant roles to a Google Sheet. You open it over breakfast and your shortlist is ready. No coding required to set up or run.

**What it costs to run:** ~$0 infrastructure (GitHub and Google Sheets are free). Anthropic API usage runs roughly $0.50–$2/month at steady state for 20–30 companies. The first week is higher while the system learns which jobs it's already seen — after that, only genuinely new postings that match your title and location filters get scored, which is typically 5–15 jobs per day.

---

## Before you start

You'll need accounts at three services. All are free or have free tiers adequate for this use case.

- **GitHub** — where the code lives and runs on a schedule ([github.com](https://github.com))
- **Google account** — for Google Sheets (your output) and Google Cloud (one-time setup)
- **Anthropic** — the AI that scores the jobs ([console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)). You'll need to add a payment method; typical usage is under $1/month.

---

## Setup

**Recommended: let Claude walk you through it.**

Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) (free account works) and paste this:

> I'm setting up an automated job search pipeline using GitHub Actions and Google Sheets. The repo is at https://github.com/jordanmilner-lgtm/strategic-copilot — can you walk me through the full setup step by step, starting with Step 1? I'll also need help finding the ATS job board handles for my list of target companies — I'll give you the company names and you can look them up.

Claude will read this README, guide you through each step interactively, and look up the ATS handles for your target companies directly — you just give it a list of company names. This is the fastest path, especially for the Google Cloud steps and company setup.

**Prefer to follow the steps yourself?** Full instructions are below.

---

## Setup — overview

1. Set up your Google Sheet
2. Get a Google Service Account (lets the script write to your sheet)
3. Fork this repo to your GitHub account
4. Add your secrets to GitHub
5. Build your scoring profile
6. Add your target companies and detect their ATS handles
7. Run your first scan

Each step is covered in detail below. The whole process takes about 30–45 minutes the first time.

---

## Step 1: Set up Google Sheets

1. Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com) and create a new blank spreadsheet
2. Give it a name like `Strategic Copilot`
3. Copy the Sheet ID from the URL — it's the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`:
   `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`**`YOUR_SHEET_ID`**`/edit`

That's it for now. **The script automatically creates all the tabs and headers the first time it runs.** You'll fill in your companies and profile in Steps 5 and 6.

### Optional tabs to add yourself

These two tabs are for your own use — the script doesn't read or write them, but they're useful as part of your search workflow:

**`1 - Master Connections`** — Your network. Export your LinkedIn connections (LinkedIn → Settings → Data Privacy → Get a copy of your data → Connections) and paste them here. Add a `Network Tier` column and mark your 20–30 highest-trust contacts as `Tier 1`. When a qualifying role appears, use this tab to find who can bridge you in.

**`4 - Proactive Targets`** — Where you log warm paths to target executives. Suggested columns:
```
Target Company | Target Executive | Their Title | LinkedIn URL | Tier 1 Bridge | Shared History | Strategic Rationale
```

---

## Step 2: Get a Google Service Account

A service account lets the script read and write your Google Sheet automatically without you having to log in each time. This is the most technical step — follow it carefully.

**2.1 Create a Google Cloud project**

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Click the project dropdown at the top → **New Project**
3. Name it `Strategic Copilot` → click **Create**
4. Make sure your new project is selected in the dropdown

**2.2 Enable the Google Sheets API**

1. In the left menu, go to **APIs & Services → Library**
2. Search for `Google Sheets API` → click it → click **Enable**

**2.3 Create a service account**

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Click **+ Create Credentials → Service Account**
3. Name it `strategic-copilot` → click **Create and Continue**
4. Skip the optional steps → click **Done**
5. You'll see your new service account listed. Click on it.
6. Go to the **Keys** tab → **Add Key → Create new key → JSON → Create**
7. A `.json` file downloads to your computer. Keep it somewhere safe — you'll need it in Step 4, then you can delete it.

**2.4 Note the service account email**

On the service account page, copy the email address — it looks like:
```
strategic-copilot@your-project-name.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**2.5 Share your Google Sheet with the service account**

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Click **Share** (top right)
3. Paste the service account email
4. Set permission to **Editor**
5. Uncheck "Notify people" → click **Share**

The script can now read and write your sheet.

---

## Step 3: Fork this repo

**New to GitHub?** GitHub is a free service that stores code and can run it on a schedule — think of it like Google Drive for code, with a built-in timer. You need a free account to use it. If you'd prefer a guided walkthrough, paste this into Claude:

> I'm setting up a GitHub repository for an automated job search tool. I have no GitHub experience. Can you walk me through: creating a free GitHub account, forking a repository, and adding secrets to it? The repo URL is [copy it from your browser address bar right now].

Otherwise, follow the steps below:

1. Create a free account at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one
2. Go to [github.com/jordanmilner-lgtm/strategic-copilot](https://github.com/jordanmilner-lgtm/strategic-copilot) and click **Fork** (top right) → **Create fork**
3. On your forked repo, click **Settings** → under the repo name, check if it's set to **Public** or **Private**. Either works — if you prefer your target companies and profile to stay private, switch it to **Private** (Settings → scroll down → Change repository visibility).
4. **Enable GitHub Actions on your fork** — GitHub disables Actions by default on forked repos. Go to the **Actions** tab on your fork and click **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**. Without this step, the scan will never run.

---

## Step 4: Add your secrets to GitHub

Secrets are how GitHub securely stores the credentials the script needs to connect to Anthropic and Google. You don't create these values yourself — each one comes from a service you already set up or can get in under a minute. GitHub stores them encrypted so they're never visible in your code or to anyone else.

Go to your forked repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**.

Add these three secrets, one at a time:

**Secret 1: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**
- *Where it comes from:* Anthropic generates this for you automatically
- Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) → **API Keys** → **Create Key** → copy the key it shows you (it starts with `sk-ant-`)
- Paste it as the value of this secret

**Secret 2: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID`**
- *Where it comes from:* it's already in your Google Sheet's URL — you don't need to generate anything
- Open your Google Sheet and look at the URL in your browser. Copy the long string between `/d/` and `/edit` — that string is your Sheet ID
- Paste that string as the value of this secret

**Secret 3: `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`**
- *Where it comes from:* this is the JSON file Google generated for you in Step 2.3, converted to a text format GitHub can store
- On a Mac: open Terminal and run:
  ```
  base64 -i ~/Downloads/your-key-file.json | pbcopy
  ```
  (Replace `your-key-file.json` with your actual filename. This copies the encoded value to your clipboard — paste it directly into the secret field.)
- On Windows: open PowerShell and run:
  ```
  [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:\Users\you\Downloads\your-key-file.json")) | clip
  ```

After adding all three secrets, you can delete the JSON file from your computer.

---

## Step 5: Build your scoring profile

The scoring profile is what makes this system work for *you* specifically. You provide your resume and a handful of sample job postings — the system analyzes them with Claude and writes your profile directly into your Google Sheet. No copy-paste needed.

**5.1 Add your resume**

In your GitHub repo, click **Add file → Create new file**. Name the file `setup/resume.txt`. Paste your full resume into the editor and click **Commit changes**.

**5.2 Add sample job descriptions**

Click **Add file → Create new file** again. Name it `setup/sample_jobs.txt`. Paste 3–5 job postings — include 2–3 roles that feel like strong fits AND 1–2 that are close but not quite right. The contrast is what helps Claude identify your real criteria. Click **Commit changes**.

*If you're using a public repo, make it private before adding these files (Settings → Change repository visibility). Delete the files after Step 5.4.*

**5.3 Run the profile builder**

Go to the **Actions** tab → click **Build Scoring Profile** in the left sidebar → click **Run workflow → Run workflow**.

The workflow reads your files, calls Claude, and writes your profile directly to the `Config - Profile` tab in your Google Sheet. It takes about 30 seconds.

**5.4 Review and complete your profile**

Open your Google Sheet and go to the `Config - Profile` tab. Review what was generated — the Background, Anchors, Keywords, and Negative Signals are filled in automatically. The **Comp Target** row is optional: if you fill it in (e.g. `$300K–$400K OTE`), each job will be flagged as `IN_RANGE`, `BELOW_RANGE`, or `NOT_LISTED`. Leave it blank to skip compensation filtering entirely.

Then delete `setup/resume.txt` and `setup/sample_jobs.txt` from your repo — navigate to each file on GitHub, click the trash icon, and commit the deletion.

**Score threshold:** defaults to 6. A score of 6 means "interesting but not obvious." Raise it to 7 if you're getting too much noise; lower it to 5 if you're missing roles you'd want to see.

**Filter settings** — the bottom four rows of the profile tab control which job titles get passed to the AI scorer. The Build Scoring Profile workflow sets these automatically, but you can adjust them:

| Field | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `Location` | Geography filter | `US only`, `Remote only`, or `Any` |
| `Seniority Keywords` | Title must contain one of these | `director, vp, head of, principal` |
| `Target Functions` | Title must also contain one of these | `gtm, sales, strategy, operations` |
| `Exclude Functions` | Title must NOT contain any of these | `engineer, legal, finance, recruiter` |

Use commas to separate values. Jobs that don't match your seniority + function criteria are skipped before scoring, keeping API costs low.

**Updating your profile later:** if your search evolves, repeat Steps 5.1–5.4 with updated materials at any time. Changes take effect on the next daily scan.

---

## Step 6: Add your target companies

Fill in your `Config - Companies` tab with the companies you want to monitor daily. Aim for 20–30 companies to start — enough for daily signal without noise.

**You only need to fill in two columns: `Company Name` and `Active`.** Set `Active` to `Y` for each company you want to monitor.

**If you're using the Claude-guided setup:** just give Claude your list of company names and it will look up the ATS type and handle for each one and tell you exactly what to enter. This is much faster and more accurate than looking them up yourself.

**If you're doing it manually:** run the **Detect Company ATS** workflow (Actions tab → Detect Company ATS → Run workflow) to auto-detect handles where possible. For any it can't find, see [Section A](#section-a-finding-a-companys-ats-handle) below.

**Think in tiers.** Not all companies on your list are equal, and that's fine — the system monitors them all the same way. But building your list with tiers in mind helps you prioritize when results come in.

**Tier A — Dream companies.** If they called tomorrow with the right role, you'd accept without hesitation. These are the companies where the mission, stage, leadership, product, and brand all align with what you're optimizing for. You know exactly why you'd want to work there. Aim for 8–12 of these.

**Tier B — Strong fits you'd pursue seriously.** Good companies where you'd be excited to interview and would likely say yes to a strong offer — but you haven't fully committed to them as your top choices. Maybe the industry is slightly adjacent, the stage isn't ideal, or you don't have a strong existing connection. These are where most of your active pipeline will come from. Aim for 10–15.

**Tier C — Worth watching.** Companies you're curious about or want to stay informed on, but wouldn't necessarily prioritize a proactive outreach. Good to have in the system so you don't miss a surprise opening, but not where you'd focus networking energy. Aim for 5–10.

**Practical sources for each tier:**
- Tier A: companies that came up in your last search that you didn't land at but wish you had; companies whose leadership you respect; companies your highest-trust network contacts have joined or spoken highly of
- Tier B: companies in your target industry at the right stage (Series B–D, growth-stage, pre-IPO); companies where you have second-degree connections; competitors to Tier A companies
- Tier C: companies you keep seeing in job alerts; adjacent industries you're open to; companies that are early but on a trajectory you find interesting

**Finding a company's ATS handle:** if using Claude, just ask it. If doing it manually, see [Section A](#section-a-finding-a-companys-ats-handle) below.

**Companies not on Ashby, Greenhouse, Lever, or Gem:** Workday, iCIMS, Taleo, Comeet, and SAP SuccessFactors don't expose public APIs. You can't monitor them directly with this system. For those companies, check their job boards manually or set a Google Alert.

## Step 7: Run your first scan

1. Go to your forked repo on GitHub
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. Click **Strategic Copilot Daily Scan** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Run workflow → Run workflow**

The scan will start within a few seconds. Click into the running job to watch the logs in real time.

**What to expect on first run:**
- Each company fetches all current jobs, applies the title/location filter, then scores what's new
- For large companies (100+ open roles), this takes a few minutes per company
- Total first-run time: 15–45 minutes depending on how many companies you have
- Anthropic API cost on first run: higher than normal, because the dedup cache is empty and every job gets scored. From the second day onward, only genuinely new postings are scored and costs drop dramatically.

After the run, open your Google Sheet and check the `3 - Opportunities CRM` tab. If you see results, you're set up correctly.

**After that:** the scan runs automatically every weekday at 7:00 AM UTC (2:00 AM Eastern / 11:00 PM Pacific). No action needed.

---

## Daily use

Open the `3 - Opportunities CRM` tab each morning. New rows from the overnight scan appear at the bottom. The columns to focus on:

- **Fit Score** (1–10) — your primary filter
- **Abstract Fit Flag** (YES/NO) — Claude's assessment of whether this is a genuine mandate match, not just keyword overlap
- **Corporate Bottleneck** — what business pain the company is trying to solve with this hire
- **Strategic Thesis** — why you are or aren't a fit, in two sentences

For roles that look promising: use the `1 - Master Connections` tab to find who in your network is connected to that company, then log the warm path in `4 - Proactive Targets`.

Add a **Status** column value (`Applied`, `Networking`, `Passed`, etc.) to keep track of what you've acted on.

---

## Adding a new company

1. Open the `Config - Companies` tab
2. Add a new row with the company name, ATS type, handle, and `Y` in Active
3. The next scheduled scan will include it automatically — no code changes needed

The first run for a new company scores all its current jobs. Subsequent runs only score new postings.

---

## Pausing or removing a company

- **Pause:** Change `Active` from `Y` to `N` in the `Config - Companies` tab
- **Remove:** Delete the row entirely

---

## Adjusting your scoring profile

Edit the values in your `Config - Profile` tab at any time. Changes take effect on the next scan.

After your first week of results, review what's coming through and ask Claude:
> "Here are some roles that scored too high [paste examples]. And some that scored too low [paste examples]. What should I adjust in my scoring profile?"

A few targeted refinements after seeing real output will improve accuracy more than trying to perfect the profile upfront.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No results in my sheet after the scan"**
Check the Actions log (click the completed run → click the job → expand the steps). Common causes:
- The title filter is blocking everything — your target companies may have few VP/Director-level GTM/ops roles open right now. Check the "After filters" count in the log.
- All jobs are already in the dedup cache (Scored URLs tab) — expected after the first run, means the system is working correctly
- The score threshold is too high — try lowering it to 5 temporarily to verify scores are being generated

**"The scan failed / showed an error"**
- Check that all three GitHub Secrets are set correctly (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)
- Verify the service account email is shared on your Google Sheet with Editor access
- If this is your first run, make sure the script ran all the way through — it creates the tabs automatically on first run

**"I'm seeing duplicate jobs"**
The `Scored URLs` tab is the dedup cache — every scored URL is written there so it's never scored again. If that tab was accidentally deleted, re-run the script and it will recreate it, but the history will be gone and the first run will re-score everything.

**"The scan is scoring too many jobs and costs are high"**
This is normal for the first 1–3 days after adding a new large company. The system scores all current jobs once, adds them to the dedup cache, and then only scores new postings going forward. Costs drop sharply after the first run per company.

**"A company's ATS handle isn't working"**
Test the API URL directly in your browser. For Ashby: `https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/HANDLE` — if it returns JSON, the handle is correct. If it returns an error, double-check the handle from the company's careers page.

---

## Section A: Finding a company's ATS handle

1. Go to the company's careers page
2. Look at the URL when you click on a job posting:
   - **Ashby:** `jobs.ashbyhq.com/**handle**/job-id` → handle is the part after the first slash
   - **Greenhouse:** `boards.greenhouse.io/**handle**/jobs/job-id` → handle is after `boards.greenhouse.io/`
   - **Lever:** `jobs.lever.co/**handle**/job-id` → handle is after `jobs.lever.co/`
   - **Gem:** `jobs.gem.com/**handle**/job-id` → handle is after `jobs.gem.com/`
3. If the URL doesn't match any of these patterns, the company uses a different ATS (Workday, Comeet, iCIMS, etc.) and can't be monitored directly

**Quick check:** paste this URL in your browser and replace HANDLE with your guess. If it returns a page of jobs, you've got the right handle and ATS.
- Ashby: `https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/HANDLE`
- Greenhouse: `https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/HANDLE/jobs`
- Lever: `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/HANDLE?mode=json`
- Gem: `https://api.gem.com/job_board/v0/HANDLE/job_posts/`

**Workday handles** use a different format: `subdomain.wdN/board` — for example `crowdstrike.wd5/crowdstrikecareers`. Find it by going to the company's careers page and looking at the URL: `https://crowdstrike.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/crowdstrikecareers` → handle is `crowdstrike.wd5/crowdstrikecareers`.
